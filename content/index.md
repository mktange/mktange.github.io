My name is Martin Kasban Tange. 

I'm a Software Engineer with a drive to help increase code quality and productivity through the use of the newest languages, technologies and tools.

I currently work at [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/) as a Forward Deployed Software Engineer based in Copenhagen, Denmark.
